# odarriba's dotfiles

This repository has several configuration files that I use in my personal computer. They are customised for me, but you can fork, improve or use them if you like.

It includes configuration of *fish*, *fisher*, *asdf-vm* and the configuration.

## usage
In order to use this dotfiles, there is several scripts to make your (and mine) life easier.

**Important note:** The software in this branch is ready to run in a **OSX** based environment.

### installation
To install the shell software, asdf and syncing the configuration, there is a script called `install.sh` that execute commands to do all of these stuff.

**NOTE:** you may want to change the `.gitconfig` file on your local copy (or you will be doing commits with my name and e-mail address).
