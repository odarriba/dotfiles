# odarriba's dotfiles

This repository has several configuration files that I use in my personal computer. They are mine, but you can fork, improve or use them if you like.

It includes configuration of *zsh*, *oh-my-zsh*, *antigen* and *powerline*. Also, it provides several setup scripts to make an automatic installation of my personal development environment.

### usage
In order to use this dotfiles, there is several scripts to make your (and mine) life easier.

#### OSX tweak script
To clone my OSX configuration (UI/UX, Finder, Dock, Terminal, iTerm, Sublime Text, etc), you can use a script called `osx.sh` that is inspired in the one available in another dotfile repository (https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), but with some enhancements and my personal configuration.

Please, read the changes that the script are going to do in order to avoid unwanted changes in your system!

#### installation of required software
To install the required software, there is a script called `install_shell.sh` that execute the commands required in order to obtain a base system compatible with the dotfiles of this repo.

This script is independent of the rest of the repository, and can be called without obtaining all the repository:

`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odarriba/dotfiles/master/install_shell.sh | sh`

This installation process is required in order to use the dotfiles because they assume that you have installed:

* zsh
* oh-my-zsh
* antigen (in `~/.antigen/antige.sh`)
* powerline (installed via `pip` and not in user-space)

#### install of ASDF version manager

I've recently moved from RBenv to [ASDF][asdf], a new lightweight version manager that support plugins, which allow you to have a unique version manager for multiple software (Ruby, Nodejs, Elixir, PostgreSQL, etc.).

To use it, just execute `install_asdf.sh` script to download dependencies, install ASDF and add it to your profile shell file.

#### deploy of my dotfiles
To deploy my dotfiles, just execute the `deploy.sh` script, re-login (or execute `zsh`) and enjoy.

#### aliases included

Some useful aliases included:

  * `be`: as a shortcut of `bundle exec` (for example, `be rails s` instead of `bundle exec rails s`).
  * `ber`: as a shortcut of `bundle exec take` (for example, `ber db:migrate` instead of `bundle exec rake db:migrate`).
  * `ms`: as a shortcut of `mix phoenix.server`.
  * `rm_dsstore`: function to remove recursively all the `.DS_Store` files in current folder and subfolders. Useful in external and network units to avoid sending lots of files not useful for non-OSX systems.
  * More... (check `.aliases` file for more aliases)
